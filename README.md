Horse Race Prediction Data Science Project

Introduction

Horse race prediction is an exciting application of data science and machine learning. The goal is to predict the outcome of horse races, which involves analyzing various factors such as horse performance, jockey skills, track conditions, and historical race data. This project combines statistical analysis, machine learning, and domain knowledge to create predictive models that can potentially forecast race results.
